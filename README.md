- 👋 Hi, I’m @Proxima-L3
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Everything and anything in STEM. I love science and technology and hope to learn as much as I possibly can in as many fields as I can. I suppose that's a bit broad and quite impossible to be able to explore ALL of them to their fullest extent in a single lifetime, so let me pick the ones that interest me the most. I have been interested in a variety of fields such as: physics, astronomy, engineering, robotics, cybernetic/neural engineering, and astronautical engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Javascript/jQuery and Django.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Not sure yet.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Just here for now..
